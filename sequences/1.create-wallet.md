title Creating a new wallet

YourClient->YourClient: Enter username

YourClient->YourClient: Up to your dApp but you can put some device\nvalidation on here like email validation etc

YourClient->YourClient: Set password

YourClient->ThisPackage: createWallet('username', 'password')

ThisPackage->YourClient: return EncryptedWallet object

YourClient->YourServer:Send to the server \n - Username\n - EncryptedWallet.wallet.ethereumAddress \n - EncryptedWallet.signature \n - EncryptedWallet.userAuthenticationToken, \n - EncryptedWallet.encryptedKeyInfo.key \n - EncryptedWallet.encryptedKeyInfo.iv\n\nThe signature is a signed hash of the encrypted\nprivate key + iv signed with your ethereum private key\n\nAs you have this signature here you in theory can\nverify the ethereum address is owned by this user.\nYou can add more authentication in here like a \njwt token or something along those lines but that\nis up to you to decide depending on your dApps\nrequirements.

YourServer->YourServer:check username doesnt already exist

YourServer->ThisPackage:verifyEthereumAddress(EncryptedWallet.signature,\nEncryptedWallet.encryptedKeyInfo,\nEncryptedWallet.wallet.ethereumAddress)\n\nThe signature is a signed hash of the encrypted\nprivate key + iv signed with your ethereum private key\n\nIf you are not using node as your backend the github\readme explains what this method does so you can\nwrite it in the language your using.

ThisPackage->YourServer:Boolean result

YourServer->YourServer:If false do not carry on and return\nand 4xx http code back to your client.

YourServer->ThisPackage:hashAuthenticationTokenOnServer(EncryptedWallet.userAuthenticationToken)\nThis returns a random salt and the server authentication hash\n(HashAuthenticationTokenOnServerResponse)\n\nIf you are not using node as your backend the github\readme explains what this method does so you can\nwrite it in the language your using.

ThisPackage->YourServer:return HashAuthenticationTokenOnServerResponse\n- HashAuthenticationTokenOnServerResponse.serverAuthenticationHash\n- HashAuthenticationTokenOnServerResponse.salt

YourServer->YourServer:Save to db mapped to username \n - HashAuthenticationTokenOnServerResponse.serverAuthenticationHash\n - HashAuthenticationTokenOnServerResponse.salt\n - EncryptedWallet.encryptedKeyInfo.key \n - EncryptedWallet.encryptedKeyInfo.iv\n - EncryptedWallet.wallet.ethereumAddress

YourServer->YourClient: Done - if your dApp uses backend calls throughout you should probably\nreturn some kind of authentication token at this point. Again its up to\nyour dApp usecase

YourClient->YourClient: EncryptedWallet.Wallet holds ethereum address \n and private key to do any signing on the client

YourClient->YourClient: Wallet has been created
