title Logging into wallet

YourClient->YourClient: Enter username and password

YourClient->ThisPackage: getAuthenticationToken('username','password')

ThisPackage->YourClient: Return the authentication token\n keccak(master_key)

YourClient->YourServer: Up to your dApp but you can put some device\nvalidation on here like email validation etc\nbefore you return the encrypted key.\nUse the authentication token as a way to identify\nthe user.

YourClient->YourServer: Get the encrypted key info for the user: \n- authenticationToken\n- username

YourServer->YourServer: Looking from db using username: \n- serverAuthenticationToken\n- salt\n- EncryptedWallet.key\n- EncryptedWallet.iv

YourServer->ThisPackage:serverHashMatchesClientHash(salt, clientAuthenticationToken, serverAuthenticationToken)\n\nMakes sure the stored auth token matches the one sending in before returning the encrypted info\n\nIf you are not using node as your backend the github\readme explains what this method does so you can\nwrite it in the language your using.

ThisPackage->YourServer:Boolean result

YourServer->YourServer:If false do not carry on and return\nand 4xx http code back to your client.

YourServer->YourServer: Done - if your dApp uses backend calls throughout you should probably\nreturn some kind of authentication token at this point. Again its up to\nyour dApp usecase

YourServer->YourClient: Returns:\n-EncryptedWallet.key\n-EncryptedWallet.iv

YourClient->ThisPackage: decryptWallet('username','password', EncryptedWallet)

ThisPackage->YourClient: Returns:\n-DecryptedWallet.ethereumAddress\n-DecryptedWallet.privateKey\nYou can use the private key to do any signing\non the client

YourClient->YourClient: Your logged in!
