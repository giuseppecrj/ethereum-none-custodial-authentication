title Generate offline recovery code

YourClient->YourClient: The user is already logged in.

YourClient->YourClient: Generate a offline recovery code

YourClient->YourClient: Enter current password

YourClient->ThisPackage: getAuthenticationToken('username','password')

ThisPackage->YourClient: Return the authentication token\n keccak(master_key)

YourClient->YourServer: Up to your dApp but as the user is logged\nin on your dApp side you probably want to\nauthentication on this endpoint.

YourClient->YourServer: Get the encrypted key info for the user: \n- username \n- authenticationToken

YourServer->YourServer: Looking from db using username: \n- serverAuthenticationToken\n- salt\n- EncryptedWallet.key\n- EncryptedWallet.iv

YourServer->ThisPackage:serverHashMatchesClientHash(salt, clientAuthenticationToken, serverAuthenticationToken)\n\nMakes sure the stored auth token matches the one sending in before returning the encrypted info\n\nIf you are not using node as your backend the github\readme explains what this method does so you can\nwrite it in the language your using.

ThisPackage->YourServer:Boolean result

YourServer->YourServer:If false do not carry on and return\nand 4xx http code back to your client.

YourServer->YourClient: Returns:\n-EncryptedWallet.key\n-EncryptedWallet.iv

YourClient->ThisPackage: generateOfflineRecoveryCode(\n'username', \n'password',\n EncryptedKeyInfo)

ThisPackage->YourClient: return GenerateRecoveryCodeResponse object

YourClient->YourServer:Send to the server \n - Username\n - GenerateRecoveryCodeResponse.offlineRecoveryCode.id\n - GenerateRecoveryCodeResponse.ethereumAddress \n - GenerateRecoveryCodeResponse.signature \n - GenerateRecoveryCodeResponse.userRecoveryCodeAuthenticationToken, \n - GenerateRecoveryCodeResponse.encryptedKeyInfo.key \n - GenerateRecoveryCodeResponse.encryptedKeyInfo.iv\n\nThe signature is a signed hash of the recovery encrypted\nprivate key + iv signed with your ethereum private key\n\nAs you have this signature here you in theory can\nverify the ethereum address is owned by this user.\nYou can add more authentication in here like a \njwt token or something along those lines but that\nis up to you to decide depending on your dApps\nrequirements.

YourServer->YourServer: Check if recovery code id already exists

YourServer->YourServer: If exists throw 4xx you can not have\nrepeated recovery code id (should never\nhappen)

YourServer->ThisPackage:verifyEthereumAddress(GenerateRecoveryCodeResponse.signature,\nGenerateRecoveryCodeResponse.encryptedKeyInfo,\nGenerateRecoveryCodeResponse.ethereumAddress)\n\nThe signature is a signed hash of the recovery encrypted\nprivate key + iv signed with your ethereum private key\n\nIf you are not using node as your backend the github\readme explains what this method does so you can\nwrite it in the language your using.

ThisPackage->YourServer:Boolean result

YourServer->YourServer:If false do not carry on and return\nand 4xx http code back to your client.

YourServer->ThisPackage:hashAuthenticationTokenOnServer(GenerateRecoveryCodeResponse.userAuthenticationToken)\nThis returns a random salt and the server authentication hash\n(HashAuthenticationTokenOnServerResponse)\n\nIf you are not using node as your backend the github\readme explains what this method does so you can\nwrite it in the language your using.

ThisPackage->YourServer:return HashAuthenticationTokenOnServerResponse\n- HashAuthenticationTokenOnServerResponse.serverAuthenticationHash\n- HashAuthenticationTokenOnServerResponse.salt

YourServer->YourServer:Insert in recovery code db table mapped to username \n - HashAuthenticationTokenOnServerResponse.serverAuthenticationHash\n - HashAuthenticationTokenOnServerResponse.salt\n - GenerateRecoveryCodeResponse.offlineRecoveryCode.id, \n - GenerateRecoveryCodeResponse.encryptedKeyInfo.key \n - GenerateRecoveryCodeResponse.encryptedKeyInfo.iv\n

YourServer->YourClient: Done

YourClient->YourClient: Show GenerateRecoveryCodeResponse.offlineRecoveryCode.userCode\nto the user for them to download or copy and save somewhere

YourClient->YourClient: Offline recovery code generated
