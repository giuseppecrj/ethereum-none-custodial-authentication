title Change Password

YourClient->YourClient: The user is already logged in.

YourClient->YourClient: Enter current password

YourClient->ThisPackage: getAuthenticationToken('username','password')

ThisPackage->YourClient: Return the authentication token\n keccak(master_key)

YourClient->YourServer: Up to your dApp but as the user is logged\nin on your dApp side you probably want to\nauthentication on this endpoint.

YourClient->YourServer: Get the encrypted key info for the user: \n- username \n- authenticationToken

YourServer->YourServer: Looking from db using username: \n- serverAuthenticationToken\n- salt\n- EncryptedWallet.key\n- EncryptedWallet.iv

YourServer->ThisPackage:serverHashMatchesClientHash(salt, clientAuthenticationToken, serverAuthenticationToken)\n\nMakes sure the stored auth token matches the one sending in before returning the encrypted info\n\nIf you are not using node as your backend the github\readme explains what this method does so you can\nwrite it in the language your using.

ThisPackage->YourServer:Boolean result

YourServer->YourServer:If false do not carry on and return\nand 4xx http code back to your client.

YourServer->YourClient: Returns:\n-EncryptedWallet.key\n-EncryptedWallet.iv

YourClient->YourClient: Enter new password

YourClient->ThisPackage: changePassword(\n'username', \n{oldPassword: 'password', newPassword: 'new_password'},\n EncryptedKeyInfo)

ThisPackage->YourClient: return EncryptedWallet object

YourClient->YourServer:Send to the server \n - Username\n - EncryptedWallet.wallet.ethereumAddress \n - EncryptedWallet.signature \n - EncryptedWallet.userAuthenticationToken, \n - EncryptedWallet.encryptedKeyInfo.key \n - EncryptedWallet.encryptedKeyInfo.iv\n\nThe signature is a signed hash of the encrypted\nprivate key + iv signed with your ethereum private key\n\nAs you have this signature here you in theory can\nverify the ethereum address is owned by this user.\nYou can add more authentication in here like a \njwt token or something along those lines but that\nis up to you to decide depending on your dApps\nrequirements.

YourServer->ThisPackage:verifyEthereumAddress(EncryptedWallet.signature,\nEncryptedWallet.encryptedKeyInfo,\nEncryptedWallet.wallet.ethereumAddress)\n\nThe signature is a signed hash of the encrypted\nprivate key + iv signed with your ethereum private key\n\nIf you are not using node as your backend the github\readme explains what this method does so you can\nwrite it in the language your using.

ThisPackage->YourServer:Boolean result

YourServer->YourServer:If false do not carry on and return\nand 4xx http code back to your client.

YourServer->ThisPackage:hashAuthenticationTokenOnServer(EncryptedWallet.userAuthenticationToken)\nThis returns a random salt and the server authentication hash\n(HashAuthenticationTokenOnServerResponse)\n\nIf you are not using node as your backend the github\readme explains what this method does so you can\nwrite it in the language your using.

ThisPackage->YourServer:return HashAuthenticationTokenOnServerResponse\n- HashAuthenticationTokenOnServerResponse.serverAuthenticationHash\n- HashAuthenticationTokenOnServerResponse.salt

YourServer->YourServer:Replace in db mapped to username \n - HashAuthenticationTokenOnServerResponse.serverAuthenticationHash\n - HashAuthenticationTokenOnServerResponse.salt\n - EncryptedWallet.encryptedKeyInfo.key \n - EncryptedWallet.encryptedKeyInfo.iv\n

YourServer->YourClient: Done

YourClient->YourClient: EncryptedWallet.Wallet holds ethereum address \n and private key to do any signing on the client

YourClient->YourClient: Change password successful
