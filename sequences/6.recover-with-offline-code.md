title Recover with offline code

YourClient->YourClient: Click recovery

YourClient->YourClient: Enter username

YourClient->YourServer: Up to your dApp but you can put some device\nvalidation on here like email validation etc\nbefore you return the recovery encrypted key.\nUse the recovery authentication token as a way to identify\nthe user.

YourClient->YourClient: Enter offline recovery code

YourClient->ThisPackage: getOfflineRecoveryAuthenticationInfo('username','offline_recovery_code')

ThisPackage->YourClient: Return:\n- recoveryAuthenticationToken\n- recoveryId

YourClient->YourServer: Get the recovery encrypted key info for the user: \n- username \n- recoveryAuthenticationToken\n- offlineRecoveryCodeId

YourServer->YourServer: Looking from db using username + offlineRecoveryCodeId: \n- serverRecoveryAuthenticationToken\n- salt\n- RecoveryEncryptedKeyInfo.key\n- RecoveryEncryptedKeyInfo.iv

YourServer->ThisPackage:serverHashMatchesClientHash(salt, clientRecoveryAuthenticationToken, serverRecoveryAuthenticationToken)\n\nMakes sure the stored auth token matches the one sending in before returning the encrypted info\n\nIf you are not using node as your backend the github\readme explains what this method does so you can\nwrite it in the language your using.

ThisPackage->YourServer:Boolean result

YourServer->YourServer:If false do not carry on and return\nand 4xx http code back to your client.

YourServer->YourClient: Returns:\n- RecoveryEncryptedKeyInfo.key\n- RecoveryEncryptedKeyInfo.iv

YourClient->YourClient: Enter new password

YourClient->ThisPackage: recoveryWithOfflineCode(\n'username', \nrecovery_code,\n'new_password',\n RecoveryEncryptedKeyInfo)

ThisPackage->YourClient: return RecoveryEncryptedWallet object

YourClient->YourServer:Send to the server \n - Username\n - RecoveryEncryptedWallet.offlineRecoveryId \n - RecoveryEncryptedWallet.wallet.ethereumAddress \n - RecoveryEncryptedWallet.signature \n - RecoveryEncryptedWallet.userAuthenticationToken, \n - RecoveryEncryptedWallet.encryptedKeyInfo.key \n - RecoveryEncryptedWallet.encryptedKeyInfo.iv\n\nThe signature is a signed hash of the encrypted\nprivate key + iv signed with your ethereum private key\n\nAs you have this signature here you in theory can\nverify the ethereum address is owned by this user.\nYou can add more authentication in here like a \njwt token or something along those lines but that\nis up to you to decide depending on your dApps\nrequirements.

YourServer->YourServer:check username + RecoveryEncryptedWallet.offlineRecoveryId exist

YourServer->YourServer:If false do not carry on and return\nand 4xx http code back to your client.

YourServer->ThisPackage:verifyEthereumAddress(RecoveryEncryptedWallet.signature,\nRecoveryEncryptedWallet.encryptedKeyInfo,\nRecoveryEncryptedWallet.wallet.ethereumAddress)\n\nThe signature is a signed hash of the encrypted\nprivate key + iv signed with your ethereum private key\n\nIf you are not using node as your backend the github\readme explains what this method does so you can\nwrite it in the language your using.

ThisPackage->YourServer:Boolean result

YourServer->YourServer:If false do not carry on and return\nand 4xx http code back to your client.

YourServer->ThisPackage:hashAuthenticationTokenOnServer(RecoveryEncryptedWallet.userAuthenticationToken)\nThis returns a random salt and the server authentication hash\n(HashAuthenticationTokenOnServerResponse)\n\nIf you are not using node as your backend the github\readme explains what this method does so you can\nwrite it in the language your using.

ThisPackage->YourServer:return HashAuthenticationTokenOnServerResponse\n- HashAuthenticationTokenOnServerResponse.serverAuthenticationHash\n- HashAuthenticationTokenOnServerResponse.salt

YourServer->YourServer:Replace in db mapped to username \n - HashAuthenticationTokenOnServerResponse.serverAuthenticationHash\n - HashAuthenticationTokenOnServerResponse.salt\n - RecoveryEncryptedWallet.encryptedKeyInfo.key \n - RecoveryEncryptedWallet.encryptedKeyInfo.iv\n

YourServer->YourServer:Remove from recovery code table using username + RecoveryEncryptedWallet.offlineRecoveryId: \n - RecoveryEncryptedWallet.userRecoveryCodeAuthenticationToken, \n - RecoveryEncryptedWallet.recoveryEncryptedKeyInfo.key \n - RecoveryEncryptedWallet.recoveryEncryptedKeyInfo.iv\nAs it has now been redeemed remove from your server

YourServer->YourClient: Done

YourClient->YourClient: RecoveryEncryptedWallet.wallet holds ethereum address \n and private key to do any signing on the client

YourClient->YourClient: Recovery successful
